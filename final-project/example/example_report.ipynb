    "# 2016 Global Ecological Footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was originally published on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint). It has been\n",
    "cleaned for your convenience: all missing values have been removed, and low-quality observations and variables have been filtered\n",
    "out. A brief descriptive summary of the dataset, originally posted on the dataset's Kaggle landing page, is provided below.\n",
    "**You\n",
    "may not copy any public analyses of this dataset. Doing so will result in an automatic F in the course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ecological footprint measures the ecological assets that a given population requires to produce the natural resources it\n",
    " consumes (including plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber and other forest products, space for\n",
    " urban infrastructure) and to absorb its waste, especially carbon emissions. The footprint tracks the use of six categories of\n",
    " productive surface areas: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (or urban) land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A nation’s biocapacity represents the productivity of its ecological assets, including cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing\n",
    " grounds, and built-up land. These areas, especially if left unharvested, can also absorb much of the waste we generate, especially\n",
    " our carbon emissions.\n",
    " \n",
    "> Both the ecological footprint and biocapacity are expressed in global hectares — globally comparable, standardized hectares with\n",
    " world average productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If a population’s ecological footprint exceeds the region’s biocapacity, that region runs an ecological deficit. Its demand for the\n",
    " goods and services that its land and seas can provide — fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, wood, cotton for clothing, and carbon dioxide\n",
    " absorption — exceeds what the region’s ecosystems can renew. A region in ecological deficit meets demand by importing, liquidating its\n",
    " own ecological assets (such as overfishing), and/or emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If a region’s biocapacity exceeds its\n",
    " ecological footprint, it has an ecological reserve.\n",
    " \n",
    "> The ecological footprint measure was conceived by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees at the University of British Columbia. Ecological\n",
    " footprint data was provided by the Global Footprint Network.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of two tables stored in the `data` folder:\n",
    "1. `ecological-info` provides information on a countries' ecological footprint.\n",
    "2. `economic-info` contains a limited amount of economic and geographical data for all countries listed in `ecological-info`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A description of each table's variables is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ecological-info`:\n",
    "* `Country`: country name\n",
    "* `Grazing Footprint`: grazing footprint in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Cropland Footprint`: cropland footprint in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Forest Footprint`: forest footprint in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Fish Footprint`: fishing footprint in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Carbon Footprint`: carbon footprint in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Total Ecological Footprint`: total ecological footprint, standardized\n",
    "* `Grazing Land`: grazing land in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Cropland Land`: cropland land in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Forest Land`: forest land standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Fishing Water`: fishing water in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Urban Land`: urban land in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Total Biocapacity`: total biocapacity in standardized hectares\n",
    "* `Biocapacity Deficit or Reserve`: difference between total biocapacity and total ecological footprint\n",
    "* `Earths Required`: The number of planet Earths required if the average human consumed as much the average citizen of this country\n",
    "\n",
    "`econ-info`:\n",
    "* `Country`: country name\n",
    "* `Region`: country region\n",
    "* `Continent`: continent where country is located\n",
    "* `Log Population (millions)`: log transformed population in millions (2016)\n",
    "* `HDI`: Human development index (HDI)\n",
    "* `HDI Rating`: Binarized HDI (\"High or Very High\": HDI > 0.7; \"Medium or Low\": HDI < 0.7)\n",
    "* `Log GDP per Capita`: log transformed gross domestic product per capita, in USD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of exploratory analyses, hypothesis tests, and predictions problems can tackled with this data. Here are a few ideas to get\n",
    "you started:\n",
    "1. Which regions' countries run the highet biocapacity deficits?\n",
    "2. Is there a relationship beteen a country's human development index and biocapacity?\n",
    "3. Is the average number of earths required by Western world significantly higher than the average required by the rest?\n",
    "4. Is there a clear relationship between a countries carbon footprint and its GDP per capita?\n",
